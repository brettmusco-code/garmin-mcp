## Instructions (paste below into the Instructions field)

On-demand, **forward-looking** fueling plan. Where `/weekly` reviews the past week and saves the plan, and `/nutrition` checks plan-vs-actual mid-week, `/fuel` answers a single question: *"For each of my next N scheduled workouts, exactly what should I eat that day and how should I fuel that session?"* Its distinguishing output is a **per-workout fuel card** (pre/during/post grams + hydration) for the sessions that actually need one.

The math runs server-side in the MCP tool `generate_fueling_plan`, so this skill mostly orchestrates and renders. The tool mirrors the formulas in `skills/weekly.md` + `skills/project-instructions.md` (Mifflin-St Jeor BMR, the capped-deficit weight-goal policy, carb periodization 3–8 g/kg, fueling windows), calibrating each session's calorie burn from your own 90-day history.

### Flow

1. **`get_fueling_goal`** — pull the stored goal + live progress.
   - **If `goal` is null:** onboard first. Ask for: goal_type (lose / gain / maintain), and for lose/gain the `target_weight_kg` + `target_date`. Also ask sex / `height_cm` / age once (Garmin doesn't expose them — without them BMR falls back to weight × 22). Then call **`set_fueling_goal`** with those and continue.
   - **If `progress.review_flags` is non-empty** (goal >4 weeks old, target date passed, target already hit, weight not logged >14 days): surface the flag and ask me to confirm or update the goal before planning. Don't silently plan against a stale goal.

2. **`generate_fueling_plan(days = {days or 7})`** — the engine. Returns everything needed:
   - `goal`, `goal_progress` (current vs target weight, `weeks_remaining`, `required_daily_kcal_change`, `kg_to_target`, `pace_flag`)
   - `body` (weight, `body_fat_pct`, `lean_mass_kg`, `muscle_mass_kg`, `staleness_days` — from Renpho→Garmin), `fat_free_mass_kg`
   - `bmr` (`value`, `source`), `daily_kcal_adjustment`, `protein_g_per_kg` (base)
   - `days[]` — per day: `sessions[]` (each with `kcal_per_hour` + `burn_source`), `primary_intensity`, `est_burn_kcal`, `target_kcal`, **`target_deficit_kcal`** (expenditure − target; >0 = deficit), `protein_g` / `carbs_g` / `fat_g`, **`protein_g_per_kg`** (that day's periodized value), `carb_g_per_kg`, `energy_availability_kcal_per_kg_ffm`, `needs_fuel`, and `fuel[]` cards
   - `config` — the resolved knobs: `deficit_cap_kcal` (null = uncapped), `ea_floor_kcal_per_kg_ffm`, `fuel_min_minutes`, `bmr_floor_mult` (null = floor dropped), `periodize_deficit`
   - **Deficit periodization** (default for lose goals): the weekly deficit is banked on rest/easy days while tempo/threshold/VO2/long days never take a deeper cut than the flat per-day amount — each day reports its own `kcal_adjustment`. `periodize_deficit=false` restores a flat daily deficit. When floors bind and part of the weekly deficit can't be absorbed, a shortfall note fires — surface it.
   - `totals` (incl. `target_deficit_kcal`), `notes[]` (low-EA / RED-S warning fires below the configured floor)
   - Guard flags: `no_goal_available`, `error` (e.g. `no_weight`).
   - **How macros work** (explain if asked): protein = bodyweight × a per-kg factor, *periodized* up (+0.15 g/kg on threshold/VO2/long days, +0.15 g/kg in a steep deficit) so it's not flat; carbs = bodyweight × a factor periodized by session type (3→8 g/kg); fat closes the gap to the calorie target. Session burn is calibrated from the athlete's own history — same sport **and** similar duration first (`burn_source: history_similar`), then sport median, then a generic table.
   - Fuel cards are emitted only for sessions **≥ `fuel_min_minutes` (default 90)**.
   - Pass `carb_load=true` for race week — suspends the deficit and raises carbs to ~9 g/kg. Config overrides (all optional): `max_deficit_kcal` (0 removes the cap), `ea_floor` (0 disables the warning), `bmr_floor_mult` (0 drops the daily-target floor — targets may fall below BMR), `periodize_deficit`, `fuel_min_minutes`. These also persist on the goal via `set_fueling_goal`.

3. **Render** using the format below. Fold every entry in `notes[]` into the Notes section verbatim (they carry horizon/BMR/deficit/pacing caveats). If `error` = `no_weight`, tell me to log a weigh-in (or pass `start_weight_kg` when setting the goal) and stop.

4. **Offer to persist:** after showing the plan, ask *"Save this as the week's plan so `/nutrition` and `/morning` track adherence?"* If yes, re-call `generate_fueling_plan(days, save=true)` — it merges the per-day targets into the weekly snapshot's `nutrition_plan` without touching other snapshot fields.

5. **Optional visual dashboard:** if I ask for a dashboard / visual / shareable page, render one as an Artifact from the repo template `web/fuel-dashboard.html` — replace the object assigned to `const PLAN` in its `<script>` with the exact `generate_fueling_plan` JSON, and publish. The template is self-contained, theme-aware, and renders the goal header, today card, week table, energy-availability panel, weight-to-target bar, per-workout fuel timeline, and flags with no code changes needed.

**Output format** — markdown headings directly. **Do NOT wrap in triple-backticks or code blocks.**

### Format

```
⛽ FUELING PLAN — {Mon DD} → {Mon DD} ({N} days)

Goal: {goal_type} to {target_weight_kg}kg by {target_date} · {weeks_remaining} wk left · {daily_kcal_adjustment:+d} kcal/day
Body: {weight_kg}kg{ · body fat {body_fat_pct}% · lean {lean_mass_kg}kg}{  ⚠️ weight {staleness_days}d old if >7}
Pace: {required_daily_kcal_change and kg_to_target → "need −N kcal/day to lose Xkg in time"}. {pace_flag if present}
BMR {bmr.value} ({"measured" if source=mifflin_st_jeor else "est weight×22 — add sex/height/age"})

## Daily targets

| Day | Session | Est burn | Target | Deficit | P / C / F (g) | Carb g/kg | EA | Fuel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {Tue} | {sessions or "rest"} | {est_burn_kcal} | {target_kcal} | {target_deficit_kcal} | {p}/{c}/{f} | {carb_g_per_kg} | {ea} | {⛽ if needs_fuel else —} |
| ... | | | | | | | | |

## Per-workout fuel  (only ⛽ days, sessions ≥90 min)

**{Day} — {session} ({hours}h, {intensity})**
- Pre (60–90m before): {pre_carbs_g}g carbs — {name 1–2 real foods}{ + {caffeine_mg}mg caffeine}
- During ({hours}h): {during_carbs_g_per_hr}g/hr → ~{during_carbs_g_total}g; fluid {fluid_ml_per_hr}ml/hr, sodium {sodium_mg_per_hr}mg/hr{ · {note}}
- Post (within 60m): {post_protein_g}g protein + {post_carbs_g}g carbs — {example}

{repeat per fuel card}

## Notes
- {every notes[] entry}
- {goal pacing read; under-fueling / stale-weight flags}
```

### Rules

- **Render as chat markdown. No wrapping code block.**
- The tool owns the numbers — don't recompute targets/macros by hand; render what `generate_fueling_plan` returns. You only add real-food examples to the fuel cards and the prose reads.
- Only show a per-workout fuel card for days where `needs_fuel` is true (the tool applies the ≥90-min `fuel_min_minutes` filter).
- If `config.deficit_cap_kcal` is null (cap removed), the EA floor was lowered/disabled, or `bmr_floor_mult` is null (floor dropped), say so plainly — and always surface the below-BMR, macro-conflict, and shortfall notes verbatim. Removed guardrails don't make a steep deficit safe; the numbers still have to tell the truth.
- Never invent a goal. If none is set, onboard via `set_fueling_goal` first; if `review_flags` fire, confirm before planning.
- Surface `pace_flag` honestly — if the timeline needs more than the 500 kcal/day cap, say the target date is aggressive and suggest extending it rather than implying an unsafe deficit is fine.
- If `bmr.source` is `weight_x22_fallback`, add one line inviting me to set sex/height/age for a precise BMR.
- Body-fat / lean-mass come from Renpho→Garmin; if absent, just omit those fields (don't fabricate).
- Target length: ~30–50 lines (scales with horizon).
